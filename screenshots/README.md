# Screenshots – SOC ELK Threat Hunting Lab

This directory contains step-by-step validation screenshots proving the successful deployment and operation of the ELK-based SOC threat hunting lab.

Each screenshot corresponds to a key milestone in the pipeline:
Suricata → Filebeat → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana.

## Purpose
These screenshots provide visual proof that:
- Logs are generated by Suricata
- Successfully shipped by Filebeat
- Processed by Logstash
- Indexed in Elasticsearch
- Actively analyzed in Kibana Discover

This mirrors a real-world SOC log ingestion and threat hunting workflow.

## Status
✅ All screenshots captured  
✅ End-to-end pipeline validated  
✅ Lab fully operational
